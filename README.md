# What are we making?

We will endeavour to make a system to control the emulated car in the tool provided to us. We will write code for the emulated car to give it the capabilities we desire as well as create an interface with which to control the car.
The following is a list of the features of the system we plan to develop develop: \
      1: The car will be controllable using a joystick or "arrow key" like interface. \
      2: The car will be controllable with voice commands. \
      3: We hope to be able to implement some sort of pathfinding system that allows the car to move autonomously to some chosen point in the environment

# Why are we making it? What problems does it solve?

By making the car be controllable with voice commands we hope to make it accessible to people unable to manually operate a computer and possibly more convenient. Autonomous navigation will make it much simpler for a user to move the car to a desired point. They can do so with many fewer inputs than if they were to steer the car themselves. The car being able to scan and map it's environment will be imperative to this feature actually working.

# How are we going to make it?

To build the system described above we are so far planning to use two coding languages: C++ and Python.
